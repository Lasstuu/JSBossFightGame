# Boss Fighting Game

JavaScript-based game that uses the Phaser framework. 


## Game Description
**Objective**

The game is a 2D “side-scrolling" (there isn’t any scrolling but the perspective is the same) fighting game where the player controls a character and needs to defeat the boss by shooting it. There are also power-ups that help the player succeed in defeating the boss.

## Core Features

**Boss Mechanics:** The boss moves around randomly on the screen and shoots the player in patterns.  
**Power-Up Pickup:** Pickup that increases the players damage.  
**Health Pickup:** Pickup that restores the players HP.  
**Scoring System:** Keeps track of the player’s best time to beat the game.  
**UI Elements:** Boss health bar, player HP, elapsed time and Power level.
